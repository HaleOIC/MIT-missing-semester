#### Why we are teaching this class

During a traditional Computer Science education, chances are you will take plenty of classes that teach you advanced topics within CS, everything from Operating Systems to Programming Languages to Machine Learning. But at many institutions there is one essential topic that is rarely covered and is instead left for students to pick up on their own: computing ecosystem literacy.

Just as the course name indicated, this course will teach the missing things in the university courses. It will cover shell programming, git, vim editor, tmux, ssh, sed, awk and even how to beatify your terminal. Trust me, this will be your first step to become a hacker !
